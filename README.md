Implementation of the Context Tree Weighting algorithm.

## Krichevskyâ€“Trofimov estimator
We compute the KT estimator with the recursive function shown on 
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Krichevsky%E2%80%93Trofimov_estimator&oldid=753863516).

We test the implementation against examples from 
Data Compression: The Complete Reference.

## How we build the trees
We don't. There are no trees. There doesen't seem to be some certain fancy
way of building them either. Have a look at the 
_On Prediction Using Variable Order Markov Models_ paper (snippet in `doc/`):

They assimilate into the tree every path they encounter in the training data.

## To improve
We're computing the KT estimate with a recursive function.
A memoized recursive function might not be the best
way to compute these values. The cache could grow very
large (or very sparse if the library throws our results).
A better way might be to update the probabilities in
the counts directly the way other libraries to it.
